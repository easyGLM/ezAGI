# funAGI
<b>fundamental augmented generative intelligence framework</b>

The funAGI workflow integrates memory management, UI/UX design, core AGI logic, user interaction interfaces, reasoning capabilities, API development, and communication modules to create a robust and scalable AGI system. Each modular component plays a crucial role in enabling funAGI to learn, adapt, and interact intelligently with its environment. THe modular framework is designed to be extended to enhance FunAGI's capabilities, making it a versatile tool for fundamental Autonomous General Intelligence development and integration with existing language models.

funAGI is designed to create a robust and scalable fundamental augmented generative intelligence system integrated with memory management, user interaction interfaces, reasoning capabilities, and API management into a modular architecture. funAGI key components include the core AGI logic from SocraticRreasoning to learn from data and make decisions, validating and drawing logic conclusions from given premise to generate conclusion. Memory management efficiently stores and retrieves conversation memories and logic creates valid truth. funAGI is designed to build upon past interactions and improve over time. API management handles API keys using dotenv allowing seamless interaction with external models such as OpenAI, groq and claude to generate responses. User interfaces offer both Command Line Interface (funAGIcli) and Graphical User Interface (funAGI) ensuring versatile and user-friendly interaction experiences. funAGI modular design allows for easy scalability and integration of new functionalities, making it a versatile and reliable tool for developing more advanced AGI systems. funAGI is developing to meet the evolving demands of AGI research and application, fostering innovation and efficiency for further development of open source augmented intelligence solutions.

# UIUX has been split into two versions<br />
<b>funAGIcli.py</b> will maintain the terminal based interaction<br />
<b>funAGI.py</b> is the UIUX graphical expression<br />

    Manages adding, removing, and listing API keys.

Core AGI Logic (agi.py):

    Initializes the AGI with API manager and chatter models.
    Learns from data by creating propositions.
    Makes decisions by leveraging SocraticReasoning.

Memory Management (memory.py):

    Handles creating necessary directories.
    Stores and loads conversation memories.
    Stores valid truths and dialogue entries.

Socratic Reasoning (SocraticReasoning.py):

    Manages premises and draws logical conclusions.
    Logs actions and results.
    Validates conclusions using LogicTables.

Logic Table Management (logic.py):

    Manages logic variables, expressions, and truth tables.
    Evaluates expressions and validates truths.
    Logs all actions and saves beliefs.

Chat Models (chatter.py):

    Interfaces for different chat models like GPT4o, GroqModel, and OllamaModel.

# Key Components and Flow

    API Key Management:
        APIManager class handles loading, saving, and managing API keys.
        In EasyAGI.__init__, the user is prompted to manage API keys if necessary.

    Learning from Data:
        AGI.learn_from_data method processes input data into two propositions.
        These propositions are added as premises to the SocraticReasoning engine.

    Making Decisions:
        AGI.make_decisions method invokes the Socratic reasoning process to draw a conclusion.
        The conclusion (decision) is returned.

    Main Loop:
        EasyAGI.main_loop handles user input and processes it using the AGI system.
        Decisions are communicated back to the user and stored in short-term memory.


Belief-Desire-Intention Model (bdi.py):

    Manages beliefs, desires, and intentions.
    Processes BDI components for decision making.


    funAGI.py is the UI. fundatmentalAGI funAGI has been published to showcase, audit and debug the easyAGI SocraticReasoning.py and logic.py

# Process Flow from User Input to Response
Step 1: User Input

    Action: The user provides an input via the command line.
    Input Example: "Explain the workflow to building AGI"

Step 2: Perceive Environment

    Method: EasyAGI.perceive_environment
    Action: The system captures the user's input.
    Output: The user's input string is returned for processing.

Step 3: Learning from Data

    Method: AGI.learn_from_data
    Action: The user's input string is processed to extract propositions.
    Process:
        The input string is split into two propositions based on a delimiter (e.g., ";").
        If the input contains only one proposition, the second proposition is set as an empty string.
        The propositions are added as premises in the Socratic reasoning engine.
    Output: Two propositions are returned for further processing.

    Adding Premises to Socratic Reasoning:
        Validates and adds each proposition as a premise.
        Logs each addition.

    skipped ::::: Processing THOT:
        Iterates through reasoning methods.
        Generates intermediate conclusions.
        Aggregates combined results.

    skipped ::::: Logging THOT Data:
        Logs premises, combined results, and final decision.
        Appends to THOT log file (thots.json).

    Drawing a Conclusion:
        Generates logical conclusion using language model.
        Validates conclusion.
        Logs conclusion.

    Communicating Response:
        Prints final decision to console.
        Logs communicated response.

    Storing Conversation Memory:
        Creates DialogEntry with input and decision.
        Saves entry to STM.

This workflow provides a comprehensive view of how user input is processed, reasoned with, and responded to in fundamentalAGI funAGI.py system. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the AGI provides accurate and logical responses based on the input provided. funAGI is the simplified agi --> SocraticReasoning --> logic --> response dialogue

# example first output from "create a framework for AGI"<br />
from mixtral using groq produced this reasonable response for meeting AGI framework as criteria<br />


1. knowledge representation and reasoning: the ability to represent and reason about complex knowledge, including objects, relationships, and events in the world. 2. natural language understanding and generation: the ability to understand and generate natural language in order to communicate effectively with humans. 3. perception and action: the ability to perceive and interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. 4. learning and adaptation: the ability to learn and adapt to new situations and environments. 5. ethics and values: the incorporation of ethical principles and values to guide decision-making and behavior. 6. safety and security: the incorporation of safety and security measures to prevent unintended behavior and protect against malicious attacks. 7. scalability and efficiency: the ability to handle large amounts of data and complex tasks without requiring excessive computational resources. 8. verifiability and explainability: the ability to prove the correctness and trustworthiness of the agi system, as well as the ability to provide clear explanations of its reasoning and decision-making processes. these components are all crucial for the development of a safe, ethical, and beneficial agi system. however, it is important to note that this framework is not exhaustive, and that the development of agi will likely involve many additional considerations and challenges. for example, agi systems will need to be able to handle uncertainty and ambiguity in a way that is consistent with human reasoning and decision-making. they will also need to be able to deal with missing or incomplete information, and to be able to learn from and make decisions based on limited data. additionally, agi systems will need to be able to interact and cooperate with humans in a way that is safe and beneficial for both parties. this will require the development of effective human-machine interfaces and the ability for agi systems to understand and respond to human emotions, intentions, and social cues. another important consideration is the potential impact of agi on society and the economy. as agi systems become more capable, they may have the potential to disrupt traditional industries and occupations, and to create new ones.

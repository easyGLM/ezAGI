# Socratic Module Documentation

## Overview
The `SocraticReasoning.py` module embodies the Socratic method's principles, emphasizing critical thinking and a questioning approach. It facilitates deep analytical discussions and problem-solving within the easyAGI framework by generating questions that explore complex ideas and uncover underlying assumptions.

## Features
- **Question Generation**: Dynamically generates questions based on the given context or subject matter, encouraging a deeper exploration and understanding.
- **Critical Thinking**: Aids in identifying assumptions, biases, and logical fallacies within arguments, promoting rigorous analysis and evaluation.
- **Dialogue Management**: Efficiently manages conversational threads to ensure focused and productive discussions.

## Usage
Integrate the Socratic module in areas of the MASTERMIND framework where analytical discussion and decision-making processes are crucial. It can be particularly useful in enhancing the system's ability to understand complex issues and facilitate learning.

## Example Implementation
```python
class SocraticQuestioner:
    def __init__(self, topic):
        self.topic = topic

    def generate_question(self):
        # Logic to generate a question based on the topic
        return "What are the underlying assumptions?"
```

# draw_conclusion
The draw_conclusion method in the SocraticReasoning class processes the premises and generates a conclusion.

   # Check for Premises:
        The method begins by checking if there are any premises available (if not self.premises:).
        If no premises are available, it logs an error message (self.log('No premises available for logic as conclusion.', level='error')) and returns the string "No premises available for logic as conclusion.".

    # Prepare Premise Text:
    
        If premises are available, it constructs a string (premise_text) that lists all the premises, each prefixed with a dash (-). This is done using a join operation on the list of premises ("\n".join(f"- {premise}" for premise in self.premises)).

    # Formulate the Prompt:
        It then creates a prompt string for the language model by combining the premise text with a query for the conclusion (prompt = f"Premises:\n{premise_text}\nConclusion?").

    # Generate the Conclusion:
        The method calls the generate_response method of the chatter object (an instance of a class like GPT4o, GroqModel, or OllamaModel) with the formulated prompt. This method interacts with an external AI service to generate a conclusion (self.logical_conclusion = self.chatter.generate_response(prompt)).

    # Log the Conclusion:
        The generated conclusion is logged directly (self.log(f"{self.logical_conclusion}")).

    # Validate the Conclusion:
        It then validates the conclusion using the validate_conclusion method. This checks if the conclusion is logically valid using truth tables (if not self.validate_conclusion():).
        If the conclusion is not valid, it logs an error message (self.log('Invalid conclusion. Please revise.', level='error')).

    # Return the Conclusion:
        Finally, the method returns the generated conclusion (return self.logical_conclusion).


## Integration Guide
To leverage the Socratic module, import it into your project, instantiate the `SocraticQuestioner` with the relevant topics, and utilize the `generate_question` method to stimulate critical discussions.

## Conclusion
`Socratic.py` is a fundamental aspect of the easyAGI project, enhancing its analytical and problem-solving capabilities by applying the Socratic method's dialectical approach to questioning and critical thinking.

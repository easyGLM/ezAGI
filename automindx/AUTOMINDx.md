# AUTOMINDX.md
Overview

The automindx folder within the easyAGI project contains essential components that enable advanced reasoning, decision-making, and logic processing for the AGI system. Below is a detailed description of the primary files in this directory: bdi.py, make_decision.py, reasoning.py, and self_healing.py.

# bdi.py

Purpose:
The bdi.py module implements the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model, which is a key component in the AGI's decision-making framework. It manages beliefs, desires, intentions, goals, and rewards to simulate human-like reasoning and goal-oriented behavior.

Key Features:

    Belief Class: Manages individual beliefs, evaluates their validity using logical operations, and reasons about them using Socratic reasoning.
    Desire Class: Represents goals or desires that the AGI aims to achieve.
    Intention Class: Encapsulates plans or actions that the AGI intends to execute to achieve its desires.
    Goal Class: Defines specific goals with conditions and priorities. Evaluates whether the goals are fulfilled based on the current beliefs, desires, and intentions.
    Reward Class: Manages the reward system, updating rewards based on the fulfillment of goals and providing a total reward score.
    Logging: Implements detailed logging for error handling and process tracking.

Example Usage:

    Initialize components such as beliefs, desires, intentions, goals, and rewards.
    Evaluate beliefs, reason about them, and execute intentions.
    Check if goals are fulfilled and update rewards accordingly.

# make_decision.py

Purpose:
The make_decision.py module facilitates reasoning from premises to conclusions to make decisions. It integrates various reasoning strategies, including deductive and inductive reasoning, and uses logical tables to validate and store truths.

Key Features:

    Proposition Class: Represents logical statements.
    DeductiveReasoning Class: Provides methods for reasoning deductively.
    InductiveReasoning Class: Provides methods for reasoning inductively.
    Reasoning Class: Encapsulates different reasoning methods.
    LogicTables Class: Manages logical variables, expressions, and truth tables. Evaluates expressions, generates truth tables, and validates truths.
    SocraticReasoning Class: Manages premises, draws conclusions, and makes decisions using a chatter model and logical reasoning.
    THOT Class: Combines results from various reasoning strategies and refines decisions using Socratic reasoning.

# reasoning.py

Purpose:
The reasoning.py module provides a comprehensive philosophical dissertation on different reasoning strategies. It includes classes for various reasoning types such as deductive, inductive, abductive, and more, each with methods to perform reasoning based on given propositions.

Key Features:

    Proposition Class: Represents logical statements used in reasoning.
    DeductiveReasoning Class: Draws specific conclusions from general premises.
    InductiveReasoning Class: Forms general conclusions from specific observations.
    AbductiveReasoning Class: Infers the most likely explanation.
    AnalogicalReasoning Class: Draws conclusions based on similarities.
    CaseBasedReasoning Class: Solves new problems based on past similar cases.
    NonmonotonicReasoning Class: Updates conclusions with new evidence.
    FormalReasoning Class: Uses formal logic systems.
    InformalReasoning Class: Uses everyday language and common sense.
    ProbabilisticReasoning Class: Uses probability to handle uncertainty.
    HeuristicReasoning Class: Uses rules of thumb or shortcuts.
    CausalReasoning Class: Identifies cause-and-effect relationships.
    CounterfactualReasoning Class: Considers alternative scenarios.
    FuzzyReasoning Class: Deals with approximate reasoning.
    ModalReasoning Class: Considers possibilities and necessities.
    DeonticReasoning Class: Involves norms and obligations.
    Reasoning Class: Integrates all reasoning strategies and provides methods to perform reasoning.

Example Usage:

    Use different reasoning strategies to draw conclusions from propositions.
    Integrate various reasoning methods to handle complex reasoning tasks.

```if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Deductive reasoning example
    p_deductive = Proposition("p: All X are Y.")
    q_deductive = Proposition("q: Z is X.")

        Proposition("p2: X2 is Y."),
        Proposition("p3: X3 is Y.")

    # Abductive reasoning example
    p_abductive = Proposition("p: X is observed.")
    q_abductive = Proposition("q: Y can cause X.")
    print(reasoning.abductive_reasoning(p_abductive, q_abductive))

    # Analogical reasoning example
    p_analogical = Proposition("p: A has feature F.")
    q_analogical = Proposition("q: B has feature F.")

    p_case_based = Proposition("p: Case C1 has properties P1, P2, P3.")
    q_case_based = Proposition("q: New case C2 has properties P1, P2, P3.")
    print(reasoning.case_based_reasoning(p_case_based, q_case_based))

    current_knowledge_nonmonotonic = [
        Proposition("p: All birds can fly."),
        Proposition("q: Tweety is a bird.")
    ]
    new_information_nonmonotonic = Proposition("r: Tweety is a penguin.")
    print(reasoning.nonmonotonic_reasoning(current_knowledge_nonmonotonic, new_information_nonmonotonic))

    # Logical conclusion
    print(reasoning.logical_conclusion())

# self_healing.py

Purpose:
The self_healing.py module implements a self-healing system for the AGI, providing mechanisms for self-monitoring, error detection, and automatic correction to ensure system reliability and robustness.

Key Features:

    System Health Monitoring: Monitors CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage to assess system health.
    Healing Mechanisms: Attempts to heal the system by restarting services, freeing up disk space, or retraining models if issues are detected.
    Logging: Logs all health checks, errors, and healing actions for audit and debugging purposes.
    Database Connection Check: Verifies database connectivity.
    Service Management: Provides methods to restart services and the entire system if necessary.

Detailed Class Descriptions:
